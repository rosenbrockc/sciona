# AGEO-Matcher Memory

## Project Structure
- `sciona/` — main package (architect, hunter, synthesizer, ingester, graph_store, cli)
- `tests/` — pytest suite; mock LLMs route by system prompt keywords (`"paradigm"`, `"sub-nodes"`, `"critic"`)
- `docker-compose.yml` — memgraph-mage + postgres + visualizer
- Sibling repo: `../ageo-atoms/ageoa/biosppy/` — ingested CDG atoms

## Key Patterns
- LLM mocking: `async def complete(system, user)` that checks `system.lower()` for keywords
- DecompositionAgent flow: `select_strategy` → (optional skeleton) → `decompose_node` → `critique` → `advance_node`
- CUSTOM paradigm has NO skeleton → root is DECOMPOSED with no pending children → done immediately
- Paradigms WITH skeletons (SIGNAL_FILTER, DIVIDE_AND_CONQUER, etc.) create PENDING intermediate nodes
- `_AcceptAllCatalog` trick: override `is_atomic()` to always return True, stops decomposition recursion

## Biosppy CDGs in Memgraph
- Upserted per-subdirectory as `biosppy.<subdir>` repos (not flat `biosppy`)
- 12 repos, 105 atoms, 26 decomposed nodes with topo_hashes
- EMG detectors (Solnik/Abbink/Bonato) are `signal_filter` concept_type with 5-7 inputs
- `upsert_cdg.py` uses non-recursive glob; subdirs need individual upsert calls

## Completed Work
- E2E test `tests/test_retrieval_e2e_hodges.py` — all 11 passing
- Fix: bypassed `select_strategy`/skeleton by calling `decompose_node` directly with pre-built state (Option D)
- Root cause: `_AcceptAllCatalog` marks all skeleton nodes ATOMIC → empty pending queue → done immediately

## Heuristic Layer Status
- Shared heuristic system is now implemented across `ageo-matcher` and `../ageo-atoms`
- Canonical shared heuristic registry lives in `../ageo-atoms/data/heuristics/canonical_registry.json`
- Family heuristic registries now live in `../ageo-atoms/data/heuristics/families/`
  - `signal_event_rate.json`
  - `divide_and_conquer.json`
  - `sequential_filter.json`
- Atom-side heuristic metadata now lives in `../ageo-atoms/ageoa/**/heuristic_metadata.json`
- Metadata format now supports multi-record files via `{"records": [...]}` so one ingested family directory can describe several heuristic-producing atoms
- Current live examples:
  - `ageoa.biosppy.ecg_zz2018_d12.assemblezz2018sqi`
  - `ageoa.biosppy.ecg_zz2018.calculatecompositesqi_zz2018`
  - `ageoa.biosppy.ecg_zz2018.calculatefrequencypowersqi`
  - `ageoa.biosppy.ecg_zz2018.calculatebeatagreementsqi`
  - `ageoa.kalman_filters.filter_rs.evaluatemeasurementoracle`
- `ageo-matcher` now loads heuristic registries and atom heuristic metadata from sibling `../ageo-atoms` with external-first precedence
- Important matcher compatibility fixes already made:
  - default heuristic asset root now correctly points at sibling `../ageo-atoms`
  - shared family registry assets using `heuristic_bindings` are normalized into matcher-side `entries`
  - external atom heuristic metadata supports multi-record files

## ECG HR Status
- Focused ECG HR optimize on the 5-minute NIGHTCAP slice now completes cleanly
- Baseline biosppy chain:
  - `bandpass_filter -> r_peak_detection -> heart_rate_computation`
  - loss around `8.862357815188158`
- Expansion plus heuristic evidence is now real, not just scaffolded
- The materially useful enrichment so far is `insert_outlier_rejection_after_detection`
  - binds to `ageoa.biosppy.ecg.reject_outlier_intervals`
  - improved focused ECG loss to about `7.958128037119418`
- The stronger current enrichment is now `insert_outlier_rejection_after_detection_median_smoothed`
  - proposal is structurally reachable from the plain `detect -> rate` scaffold
  - binds to:
    - `ageoa.biosppy.ecg.reject_outlier_intervals`
    - `ageoa.biosppy.ecg.heart_rate_computation_median_smoothed`
  - latest successful rerun:
    - output dir: `output/principal_optimize_20260410_123651`
    - baseline trial 1: `8.862357815188158`
    - selected expansion trial 2: `7.741363964117423`
    - proposal selection result in `trial_history.json` is `selected=expansion`, `selected_reason=best_admissible_improvement`
- Earlier jump-removal-only enrichment improved very little and confirmed that weak enrichment assets are a bigger bottleneck than proposal routing alone
- SQI existed as an expansion option before, but did not fire because the runtime heuristic/evidence layer was too weak and mismatched to the observed failure mode
- Key lesson: heuristics need to be first-class, de-jargonized, and cross-family; expansions should consume heuristic evidence, not only raw telemetry or domain-specific ad hoc rules
- Important recent bug fixes that enabled the median-smoothed win:
  - cohort reporting now records score-excluded labels, not only guidance-excluded labels
  - expansion rules can now propose a robust smoothed terminal measure stage directly from the baseline scaffold
  - `ageo-atoms` now has `ageoa.biosppy.ecg.heart_rate_computation_median_smoothed`
  - graph rewriter parent/depth inference now considers newly appended RHS nodes, so terminal rewrite nodes become root children and are emitted by the synthesizer composition
- Important failure artifact to remember:
  - earlier failed rerun `output/principal_optimize_20260410_110754`
  - median-smoothed proposal was generated but scored as `1e12` because the synthesizer composition returned `reject_outlier_intervals_result` instead of the final robust-smoothed rate node
  - this was fixed by the graph rewriter parent/child propagation patch, not by changing heuristics

## Federation / Namespace Risk
- Current abstractions are mostly helping rather than hurting the future `sciona.atoms.*` direction
- The main rename debt is not in the heuristic meaning layer; it is in package/import/path assumptions
- Hard-coded `ageoa` assumptions still exist in matcher runtime/import/discovery code
- Future goal is not just “rename `ageoa` to `sciona.atoms`”
- Real target is a federated provider model where multiple repos can supply assets and atoms under a common logical namespace
  - examples: `sciona.atoms.physics`, `sciona.atoms.fintech`
- Important future requirement:
  - separate logical atom identity from import FQDN and from asset repository path
- A dedicated architecture plan for PEP 420 plus federated atom providers is needed before too much more package-aware logic accumulates
